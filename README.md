## A game made for GitHub's GameOff2022

Curious Cats is a 2D puzzle game made to follow the theme of "clich√©" and was completed within a month!

Gather up the cats as they escape and roam around the world! Use your cats as resources and have them manipulate the terrain around them. A sweet and short puzzle game with completely handmade art assets!

Use WASD and mouse scroll wheel to control the camera. Press Space to pause the game. Otherwise, mouse click is all you need!

The game is based on "power-ups" that you can see on the bar on the left, and you can give them to cats by selecting a button and then clicking on a cat. Use different power-ups to allow the cats to get to the goal!
